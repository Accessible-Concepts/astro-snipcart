## Install

```sh
npm install @lloydjatkinson/astro-snipcart
```

## Snipcart API key environment variable

Firstly make sure to have read how to define and read environment variables in the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/).

This integration requires an environment variable named `PUBLIC_SNIPCART_API_KEY`. Remember, do not hardcode [magic strings](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/365339/what-is-wrong-with-magic-strings) and do not commit secrets to a repository.

#### CI/CD - GitHub Actions

If you are using GitHub Actions as your build pipeline then you can use secrets and environment variables. Here is a job that allows a project using Astro Snipcart to access secrets as environment variables.

```yaml
- name: Setup environment variables
    env:
    PUBLIC_SNIPCART_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.PUBLIC_SNIPCART_API_KEY }}
    run: |
      # cd astro-snipcart-shop # optional step for monorepos etc
      touch .env
      echo PUBLIC_SNIPCART_API_KEY="$PUBLIC_SNIPCART_API_KEY" >> .env
```

## Setting up Snipcart

This component is required to be imported into the `<head>` of your site. This could be in a hypothetical base layout/application shell type component. For example consider a typical BaseLayout component.

> âš  Take note of the `/astro` in the import path. This is to future proof the integration if or when other client side frameworks also get specific support by this Astro integration.

```astro
---
import { SnipcartSetup } from '@lloydjatkinson/astro-snipcart/astro';
---
<html>
    <head>
        ...
        <SnipcartComponent />
    </head>
    <body>
        <slot />
    </body>
</html>
```

## Allowing a customer to open their cart

Now that `<SnipcartSetup />` has loaded Snipcart it's time to start using the other components the integration provides.

```astro
---
import { CartCheckout } from '@lloydjatkinson/astro-snipcart/astro';
---
<BaseLayout>
    <CartCheckout>
        <button>
            Open basket
        </button>
    </CartCheckout>
</BaseLayout>
```

Clicking the button should now open the basket with a `Your cart is empty.` message.

## Defining your first product

Remember, Snipcart is a code-first approach to creating an e-commerce shop. That is, products are not configured from within Snipcart. This puts you and your application in full control of product definitions.

Your products can therefore be setup flexibly, such as:

 * Simple Markdown files with the frontmatter containing the YAML frontmatter defining the title, price, variants, etc.
 * JSON files
 * Your own backend API 

As long as the end result is HTML that Snipcart can scrape (or a custom JSON returning API) during it's [order validation](https://docs.snipcart.com/v3/setup/order-validation) phase of the transaction then it does not matter where the product definition resides.

```astro
---
import { Product } from '@lloydjatkinson/astro-snipcart/astro';
---
<Product
    as="span"
    id="SKU-0001"
    name="Standard T-Shirt"
    url="/product/standard-t-shirt"
    price={ 12.99 }
    description="Every day basic t-shirt"
    image="/blue-t-shirt.jpg">
    <button>
        Add
    </button>
</Product>
```

> Remember, Snipcart needs to know which URL to load to query as part of it's order validation. You'll likely have a page for each product, so you could pass that URL to the `url` prop.

## Component props, TypeScript definitions, and Snipcart attributes

The components in this integration expose the same functionalities described in the Snipcart [products definition](https://docs.snipcart.com/v3/setup/products) documentation.

For example, to make use of the custom fields functionality use the component like so:

```astro
---
---
<Product
    as="span"
    id="SKU-0001"
    name="Standard T-Shirt"
    url="/product/standard-t-shirt"
    price={ 12.99 }
    description="Every day basic t-shirt"
    image="/blue-t-shirt.jpg"
    customFields={[
        { name: 'Size', options: ['Small', 'Medium', 'Large'], placeholder: 'Choose size', required: true },
        { name: 'Pattern', options: ['Abstract', 'Neon', 'Tiger[+5.00]'] }
    ]}>
    <button>
        Add
    </button>
</Product>
```

When the customer adds this product to their basket they will be presented with the following:
